Old Risks and Challenges
Some appliances use water automatically, which could result in Hydroleak returning false positives for leaks. An example of such
an appliance is the ice maker in some refrigerators. In order to prevent false positives, we need to develop an algorithm that
intelligently determines if there is a leak or if an appliance temporarily using water.

We need to program a user-friendly smart phone app and set up servers for Hydroleak. We also need to purchase machinery to set
up our manufacture process.
