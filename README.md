Pressure system: Abandoned! (Used two pressure sensors at each end of pipe)

Camera system: Idea under consideration. (Use camera to track triangular leak detector on water meter)

How it works

Our current plan: Flow rate system (Flow sensor and flow switch. If flow is not zero, and faucets are off, there's a leak)

The branches reflect the 3 possible systems we were considering. 

Pressure system: rejected at the very beginning beacuse of practicality

Flow Rate sytsem: The system we were using for the first half of the semester. We realized from customer feedabck that the installation process would be too annoying because they would half to call a plumber and cut their pipes ao this also got rejected and we went on to the current idea: camera system

Camera system: The current system. Uses image differencing to take pictures of your water meter and compares them to tell if water is flowing through your pipes. Very easy installation- you just clip it onto your water meter. See camera system branch
