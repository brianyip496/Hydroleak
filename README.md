Got banned from several forums immediately. Decided to post again, asking for suggestions instead of blatently advertising.
These posts stayed up for some time and got responses, but eventually got us banned from everywhere again.
Handing out flyers didn't work well, so we become more aggressive and talked directly to people, asking them if they want
to subscribe and recording their emails. Receieved some notable feedback suggesting some additions such as constant monitoring and consumption metrics.

The branches reflect the 3 possible systems we were considering. 

Pressure system: rejected at the very beginning beacuse of practicality

Flow Rate sytsem: The system we were using for the first half of the semester. We realized from customer feedabck that the installation process would be too annoying because they would half to call a plumber and cut their pipes ao this also got rejected and we went on to the current idea: camera system

Camera system: The current system. Uses image differencing to take pictures of your water meter and compares them to tell if water is flowing through your pipes. Very easy installation- you just clip it onto your water meter. See camera system branch
