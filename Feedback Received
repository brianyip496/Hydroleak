The one point of feedback that we received from the first round of forum posts before we were banned was that flow flow rate
system would be a huge hassle to install. This was after we got the idea of the camera system, and we just posted to forums to 
verify that people would be discouraged by the prospect of an expensive installation. 

We received a lot more feedback in the second round of posting to forums. 
The main issues that were raised were:
  -There was no continuous monitoring in the system at that time
  -Add a web portal for access to monitoring information
  -Add metrics to track overall water consumption

We tried to implemented all these ideas in the final design for Hydroleak.
